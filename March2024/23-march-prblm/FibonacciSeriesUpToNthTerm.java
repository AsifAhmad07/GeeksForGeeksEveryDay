    Name Of The Problem :- Fibonacci series up to Nth term

    POTD :- 23-march-2024


    You are given an integer n, return the fibonacci series till the nth(0-based indexing) term. Since the terms can become very large return the terms modulo 109+7.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
Output:
0 1 1 2 3 5
Explanation:
0 1 1 2 3 5 is the Fibonacci series up to the 5th term.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 10
Output:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
Explanation:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 is the Fibonacci series up to the 10th term.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function Series() which takes an Integer n as input and returns a Fibonacci series up to the nth term.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

Constraint:
1 <= n <= 105

    int[] Series(int n) {
        // code here

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD;
        }
        return dp;
    }
